        <img src="./images/1.avif">
        <p>Conceding defeat in the Karnataka assembly election, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday said the
            Bharatiya
            Janata Party has not been able to make the mark, while the Congress did it successfully.</p>
        <p>Bommai's reaction comes even as the Congress was striding forward with leads in 128 seats, while the BJP was
            ahead in
            66 in Karnataka, according to Election Commission of India trends, as votes were counted on Saturday for an
            election
            widely seen as a litmus test for both parties ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.</p>
        <p>“We have not been able to make the mark. The Congress has done it successfully… Once the results come we will
            do a
            detailed analysis. As a national party, we will not only analyse but also see what deficiencies and gaps
            were left
            at various levels. We take this result in our stride,” the Karnataka chief minister told reporters.</p>

        <p>Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Saturday hoped that Rahul Gandhi becomes the prime minister of the country in

            2024
            Lok Sabha elections after Basavaraj Bommai conceded defeat in the Karnataka Assembly Election 2023. "It is a
            mandate
            against Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and JP Nadda. PM Modi came to Karnataka 20 times. No PM in the past
            campaigned
            like
            this," Siddaramaiah who is a top contender for the CM post said.</p>
        <p>"This is a victory for a secular party!! People of Karnataka wanted a stable government that delivers as
            promised, and hence have given the mandate for Congress!!" Siddaramaiah tweeted.</p>
        <p>Talking about the ramifications of the Karnataka results coming after a bitterly fought battle, Siddaramaiah
            said
            this is a stepping stone to the Lok Sabha election. "I hope all non-BJP parties come together and see that
            BJP is
            defeated and I also hope Rahul Gandhi may become the PM of the country," Siddaramaiah said.</p>
